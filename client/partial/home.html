This is the boring front end. It shows little and only exists to put the
controllers into context. You should be reading the controller code to see what
is going on.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#/inheritByInjector">
      Inherits from the base controller with no prototype functionality via $injector
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#/inheritPrototypically">
      Inherits from the base controller with prototype functionality prototypically
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
